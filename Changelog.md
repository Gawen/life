## OK, so variables and instructions are actually english words
Friday July 28 1995

There is this program I can access through the DOS named ``QBasic``.

And actually it looks like the same than the Mupy. But there, variables and instructions are no longer numbers and images but English words.

My very first program:

    10 INPUT A
    20 INPUT B
    30 PRINT A+B

You can use this code, I licensed it under the MIT license. (You're welcome)

## Hey honey, I found this computer, it will teach you how to program
Sunday April 09 1995

Once, my mom came back with this weird box from a bric-a-brac sale.

There was a book, and a big calculator with weird keys with numbers and images on them.

The book told me how to create a program to ask the user a number, then an other, and prints the sum. Or other stuffs like that.

Later, I understood this was actually a computer for children, with a very simple BASIC interpreter inside, based on a 4 bits microcontroller. It was aimed to learn children how to program. This toy was built in 1985 by a French company.

Unfortunately I lost this precious object. I'm looking actively to get a new one.

This definitely started my geek life.

## My first computer
Monday March 21 1994

My father needed to write a dissertation for his job. He wanted to try writing it on a computer for the first time.

Moreover my parents thought the computer thing may be something important in the future, and they wanted me to know few things about it.

Best decision ever...
