## The unfair pivot of my student life
Saturday September 01 2007

During entrance examination, there is one special test named [TIPE](http://www.scei-concours.fr/), épreuve commune d’évaluation des Travaux d’Initiative Personnelle Encadrés. This is an oral presentation about a scientific problematic I chose and I studied for one year.

I decided to study [sorting algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm). Because there are ones of the most fundamental algorithms in computer science, and because there is not a best solution for all cases, they fascinated me and I wanted to know more about them.

I bought the reference's bible, [The Art of Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming) Volume 3 of [Donald Knuth](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/), and I based my work on his work.

Then I decided to create some kind of Virtual Machine dedicated to execute sorting algorithms to automatically generate statistics about them: read and write's count, memory usage, operation's count, time of execution, ... And this for thousands of unsorted data set. I deduced of these informations very precise empirical time and memory complexities for different kind of set: best case, worst, medium, random cases...

I had a lot of fun studying them. My prépa's teachers told me it was good work. I was definitely ready for the examination.

One morning, in the [University Paris 5, René Descartes](http://www.univ-paris5.fr/), I began to present my work to two professors. The weren't listening. One was reading a newspaper and the other was playing with his pen.

But I did not care, because we are trained for this kind of situation. So I continued without being destabilized. I showed everything I had: code sources, complexities plots and formula for each algorithm. And it was good.

I was presenting the [quicksort algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort), the final one of my presentation. I explained its concept of "[pivot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort#Formal_analysis)" and so how it can be perfectly [parallelizable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort#Parallelization).

The pen's player professor then asked me

    Excuse me, how can you say it is parallelizable over several computers whereas we need at each step all the set of data ?

So I re-explained the concept of pivot. Still not understanding. I gave an example. Fail again...

    OK, you seem to do not know what you're talking about. Let's continue...

Fair enough, that is the game. I stayed focus.

And it follows a flood of weirds questions. The newspaper's guy asked me some which definitely proved he wasn't listening. Then I realized they did not understand the problematic. Maybe because I did not explain it well, but I suppose mainly because they just did not care : one were a biologic highscool's teacher, and the other a physicist. The assignement of teachers for my TIPE examination was wrong.

I was starting to be furious. But poker-face.

Then, they finished me.

    With what tool did you generate your plots ?

Read "You are a cheater, I want to know you did not generate yourself these plots.". I was K.O. I can remember the all discussion.

    - Well, [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/)
    - How did you generate them ?
    - Sorry ?
    - What did you do on gnuplot to generate these plots ?
    - I'm sorry the last time I used it was two months ago before the beginning of my examinations. I can't remember.
    - Oh yeah ... You **can't** remember.
    - Well, I made a shell script which were calling gnuplot with the good parameters.
    - And how did you scale your plots ?
    - I can't remember.
    - Sure.
    - I think it's something like blablabla
    - Of course... You **think**...

They thought I was a liar. I had a F.

This exmaination was emilinatory.

I could not access to French public schools because of this. Because I could not remember how to scale a plot in gnuplot. Because I could not explain what is a pivot.

This morning was a pivot of my life.

## I was so stressed I hacked the backend of one of the school I was pretending to to know in what position I was
Wednesday August 01 2007

And this is how I learned Python !

(OK I'm not proud...)

## I'm 37th of Prologin with only 50% of my code.
Sunday April 24 2005

I've always discovered programming and worked on projects on my own. I spent a lot of time on the [Games Creators Network's IRC channel](irc://irc.langochat.net:6667/gcn) talking about my passion with other geeks though, but I've never met real ones IRL.

So I decided to do [Prologin 2005](http://prologin.org/) which is a National French & Belgian contest, organized by [EPITA](http://epita.fr/), where people under 18 has to solve algorithmic problems. This was done in three steps : Pre-selection, Semi-Finale, and Finale. I succeeded the first two steps and went to the [Finale, in Paris](http://www.prologin.org/gallery/Prologin%202005,Finale).

We were something like 100 people there, and this was great to finally meet people I talked with over the Internet. Well, we were **really** the perfect stereotype of the White'n'Nerdy, but it was fun and I enjoyed.

![White'N'Nerdy](http://www.prologin.org/files/photos/Prologin%202005/Finale/100_2295.jpg)

The final subject was to create an AI robot whose goal is to (1) build hotels to gain money and (2) fight against other players' bot in a 2D virtual world. The winner is the one which builds most hotels or the last survivor.

![Hatamis-Maun playground](http://www.prologin.org/files/photos/Prologin%202005/Finale/100_2291.jpg)

The contest lasted 36h non-stop. Pretty intense uh. Especially when 1h before the end, power shutdowned for no reason and a lot of work were lost. I got back only 50% of my work, and too pissed off to fix it, I just send it in the state.

![Power shutdown](http://www.prologin.org/files/photos/Prologin%202005/Finale/l102.jpg)

I finally finished 37th of the contest, and met a lot of great people there I'm still in contact with.

## Show HN: GBAB, a compiler to transforms BASIC to C for GameBoy Advance.
Friday June 08 2001

But unfortunately, I don't have the source anymore. I'm actively looking for it in my old hard-drives. But I think it's definitely lost.

The probable only remaining sign on earth of GBAB is scratched on a wood table, in a natural park of Oregon, USA. I went there with my American host family I stayed with for 1 month in August 2001. I explained how it worked, probably because I was bored.

## I just learnt Visual Basic

This was a pretty good language to learn. But at that time I didn't know Python yet though...

## 3.141592654...
Wednesday July 15 1998

My mother took me to [Palais de la Découverte](http://www.palais-decouverte.fr/) and [this room amazed me](http://www.palais-decouverte.fr/index.php?id=824].

I read that the number Pi is great. I only knew it makes us able to calculate the length of a circle given its radius. And I don't know why but I was fascinated.

Probably because Pi cannot be calculated with a multiplication or a division or something. I thought maybe with a square root, but I tried to power-two it but the number is not simple either.

So I searched a way to calculate it.

My first reflex was to project a circle over a set of contiguous and length-constant lines, like this

![Circle in a set of lines](http://gawen.me/life/images/pi_circle.jpg)

If I could transform a circle in 12 little lines like the ones in red, and I calculated the length of one of these lines, I could add an approximation of Pi by multiplying its length by 12.

And the more I added lines, the more I would have a better approximation of Pi.

So I asked one of my friend's mother who were a Math teacher how to calculate the length, and she gives me the [Al-Kashi Formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_cosines).

When applied to my schema, with a lot of help from my mother, it gives something like

![Pi Formula](http://gawen.me/life/images/pi_formula.gif)

If S = 500, it gives the first 4 digits right.

The funny story about this is I only knew degree angle, and not radian. In radian, 360° would be 2pi. And obviously a formula which needs Pi to calculate Pi is not really ... optimized.

But this is a cool formula to extract Pi from the degree-cosinus implementation of your calculator :)

(I can't find my notes, there are probably lost for ever. So I don't know if this is this exact formula I found. But it's surely something like this.)

## With 3 sounds, I can make computers talk with each other
Friday June 13 1997

I knew some computers could talk with each other over phone lines. I already heard the sound passing through the phone line (I don't remember how because I didn't have any modem that time). But I knew this noise was probably the data.

R2-D2 was doing simpler sounds to talk with C3PO though. In my electronic club, they told me how to generate such sounds (sine waves) and how to detect them. So I thought I could build a R2-D2-like modem.

But I asked myself : "how many sounds do I need ?" ("How many signals do I need to transmit data between two computers".)

And after a lot of thought, Eureka, my answer is 3.

Why ?

I can't remember. That's what I read from my manual, but I don't understand what I wrote.

Actually I kind of realized I had to send something like a clock through the line to make the receiver distingish each bit. That would mean I'd need 2 bits : one for the data, and one for the clock. That'd mean 4 sounds (one for 00, 01, 10 and 11).

But for some reason I decided it was 3, and even now I can't understand my manuals when I try to explain why. 3 is actually a good answer because it is possible for each bit send to change the sound and so avoid the fact the receiver will confuse two bits in one. But the decoding is kind of complex, requires graph theory, and I seriously don't think I got that at that age.

So if anybody understands why I tried to do this, please comment! :-)

## My first political virus
Tuesday May 27 1997

There is this French politician named "Le Pen" who prefers to spread hatred between peoples than peace and cooperation. And as my familly is pretty politically engaged and my father-side family is from Algeria, I decided to create the most powerful and anti-racist computer Virus ever existed : a Virus which will print "Le Pen is a big c***" when the computer starts.

Here some notes I wrote about this powerful Virus (in **QBasic** !).

![Page 1](http://gawen.me/life/tutorials/lepen/page_1.jpg)

Virus: Le Pen

1 Its role.

It won't do any anomaly on the computer it will reside on.
It'll put in ``AUTOEXEC.BAT`` one line which will prints: "LE PEN IS A BIG C***".

2 How it does it ?

It'll add in ``AUTOEXEC.BAT`` some lines which will be :

    CLS
    ECHO .  <-- (10 times)
    ECHO LE PEN IS A BIG C*** (or NINNY)
    ECHO .  <-- (9 times)
    PAUSE
    CLS


NB: I was a bit ashamed to have used the C-word, so I replaced it by 'ninny' in case my parents read my book.

![Page 2](http://gawen.me/life/tutorials/lepen/page_2.jpg)

The silent install program

    10 OPEN "C:/AUTOEXEC.BAT" FOR INPUT AS #1
    20 OPEN "C:/AUTOEXE1.BAT" FOR OUTPUT AS #2
    30 INPUT #1, A$
    40 IF EOF(1) THEN GOTO 70
    50 PRINT #2, A$
    60 GOTO 30
    70 FOR A = 1 TO 5
    80 PRINT #2, "ECHO "
    90 NEXT A
    100 PRINT #2, "ECHO LE PEN IS A BIG ****"
    110 CLOSE #1
    120 CLOSE #2
    130 END


Sorry, the code is not indented.

Please use at your own risk. This could damage your computer irremediably!

## V = R * I
Thursday April 04 1996

It was like normal afternoon children activities, like sports, but here for sciences.

Some great guys explained me how works a resistor, transistor, ... These was awesome times. I went there every Wednesday afternoon for several years.

## OK, so variables and instructions are actually english words
Friday July 28 1995

There is this program I can access through the DOS named ``QBasic``.

And actually it looks like the same than the Mupy. But there, variables and instructions are no longer numbers and images but English words.

My very first program:

    10 INPUT A
    20 INPUT B
    30 PRINT A+B

You can use this code, I licensed it under the MIT license. (You're welcome)

## Hey honey, I found this computer, it will teach you how to program
Sunday April 09 1995

Once, my mom came back with this weird box from a bric-a-brac sale.

There was a book, and a big calculator with weird keys with numbers and images on them.

The book told me how to create a program to ask the user a number, then an other, and prints the sum. Or other stuffs like that.

![mupy](http://gawen.me/life/images/mupy_pic.jpg)

Later, I understood this was actually a computer for children, with a very simple BASIC interpreter inside, based on a 4 bits microcontroller. It was aimed to learn children how to program. This toy was built in 1985 by a French company.

Unfortunately I lost this precious object. I'm looking actively to get a new one.

This definitely started my geek life.

## My first tutorial
Thursday November 17 1994

My mother explained me how worked the MS-DOS thing and this very beautiful and nice rendered MS Windows 3.11 (state of the art). Here's a HOWTO tutorial to open a .DOC file from a floppy.

Explanation to enter in a floppy which doesn't have any name in a 386SX computer.

You press on the "W" key then you press on the "Enter" key. After you click on the "Window" press on the screen then you press the sentence at the very top of the square. You go to "File Explorer" You put ...

* Way to write on computer

To put a file you go to File Explorer. You go to the C:/ key on the screen. You go to Window the key on the screen you go to DOC. You take your font. You click once. You go in "File". You go in "Copy". The computer asks you in which thing there you put the floppy. Go in "Copy".

## My first computer
Monday March 21 1994

My father needed to write a dissertation for his job. He wanted to try writing it on a computer for the first time.

Moreover my parents thought the computer thing may be something important in the future, and they wanted me to know few things about it.

Best decision ever...
