The classes preparatoires are a kind of special training courses of 2 years. This is, I quote, "a post-secondary preparatory school / classes preparing for entrance examinations to the French Grandes Ecoles. The preparation for the entrance examinations to the French Grandes Ecoles begins after a student has obtained a Baccalaureat diploma (equivalent of A-levels in Britain, marks the end of high-school education and qualifies a student to enter university)."
